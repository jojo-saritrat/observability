# Workshop 02 OpenSDK Setup for Traces, Logs, and Metrics

## Introduction

In this guide, we will set up **OpenSDK** to manage **traces**, **logs**, and **metrics** for your application. OpenSDK uses **OpenTelemetry** to capture telemetry data and export it for analysis, providing a comprehensive view of your application's performance and behavior.

### **Traces**
Traces allow you to monitor and visualize the journey of a request through your system, providing insights into latency and service interactions.

### **Logs**
Logs are generated from within your application and provide detailed information about its execution, such as errors, warnings, and informational messages. These logs help you understand what happens within your system.

### **Metrics**
Metrics help you track and measure specific events in your system, such as request counts, processing time, and resource usage. Metrics allow you to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential issues.

In this setup, we will guide you through configuring OpenTelemetry to collect, process, and export these traces, logs, and metrics from your application. By the end of this guide, you will be able to see real-time data about your applicationâ€™s performance and troubleshoot effectively.

### Steps Covered in This Guide:
1. **Setting up the OpenTelemetry SDK** to capture traces, logs, and metrics.
2. **Installing dependencies** required for OpenTelemetry and instrumentation.
3. **Viewing the captured data** in the console to understand how traces, logs, and metrics are handled.
